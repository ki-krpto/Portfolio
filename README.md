# Portfolio
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository showcases my learning journey in the field of cybersecurity, with a focus on penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and Python automation. Below, you'll find a record of my completed projects, write-ups, and labs, along with their completion dates.

**Dancing (Hack the box)**
Learned how to connect to SMB using Parrot OS anonymously
Tools used **Nmap** **SMB** 

### Python Scripts for Pentesting ###
Here, when I do make them I'll store scripts I build to automate some common tasks for Pentesting

### Capture the Flag (CTF) solutions ###
Will start these soon

### Cybersecurity skills developed so far ###
- 

### Tools and Resources ###
** Operating systems **: Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Parrot OS, Windows 7, windows xp, 
** Learning platforms ** Codeacademy, Georgia Wiedman (Penetration Testing), Hack the box, Thr Great Courses (How to program computer science concepts and python exercises)

### Future Projects ###
- Continue to work on Labs and start CTF challenges to learn more about pentesting
- develop some Python scripts to automate Pentesting and make it easier
- Finish my Penetration Testing book by Georgia Weidman
